# Spatial N-Back
This script is based almost entirely on code originally written 
by Stephen Van Hedger.  

## Task Description
The n -back task is a continuous performance task that is commonly used
as an assessment in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to measure
a part of working memory and working memory capacity. The n -back was 
introduced by Wayne Kirchner (1958). Participants must monitor a continuous 
stream of stimuli (here, auditory stimuli) and respond based on whether 
the current stimulus matches the one presented 'n' stimuli previously.


## Notes about Script
The script is easily customizable. It is simple to change the presentation
rate of the stimuli, the level of n, the relative number of targets and 
non-targets, and the actual sounds themselves. At present, you can 
select from letters and spatial locations. Just change the
'imageType' variable.  

## Using the Script
The script outputs two important variables. The first is 
'nback' which should be added to the experiment timeline
in the main html file -- e.g., timeline.push(nback);

The second is 'return_nback_folder' which should be pushed or
concatenated with other audio files for preloading purposes.
This is a function, so users can specify a different folder
name in the main html file

-- e.g., var foldername = return_nback_folder();
